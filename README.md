<h1 align="center">Movies Website üçø</h1>

## About The Project

This was a university assignment for _CAB230 - Web Computing_. The website was built using React with Bootstrap and utilises the [Movies Database API](https://github.com/Philllipe/movies-database-API/) to retrieve and store data in a MySQL Database. It allows searching capabilites with filters and implements infinite scrolling using AG Grid for movie lists. The website has functionality for user accounts, which have specific access to certain pages. The website implements and uses JWT for authentication and authorization for user accounts.
